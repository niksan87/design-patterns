# STRUCTURAL/BRIDGE PATTERN

## DEFINITION

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary
independently.

## EXMPLANATION

The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate
responsibilities into different classes.

When a class varies often, the features of object-oriented programming become
very useful because changes to a programâ€™s code can be made easily with minimal
prior knowledge about the program. The bridge pattern is useful when both the
class and what it does vary often. The class itself can be thought of as the
implementation and what the class can do as the abstraction. The bridge pattern
can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.
