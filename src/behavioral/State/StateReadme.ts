/**
 * 
 * BEHAVIORAL/STATE PATTERN
 * 
 * DEFINITION: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state
 * changes. The object will appear to change its class.
 *
 * EXPLANATION: This pattern is used in computer programming to encapsulate
 * varying behavior for the same routine based on an objectâ€™s state object. This
 * can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without
 * resorting to large monolithic conditional statements.
