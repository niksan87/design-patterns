# CREATIONAL/SINGLETON PATTERN

## DEFINITION

Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

## EXPLANATION

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that
restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when
exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The
concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when
only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number
of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

There is criticism of the use of the singleton pattern, as some consider it an
anti-pattern, judging that it is overused, introduces unnecessary restrictions
in situations where a sole instance of a class is not actually required, and
introduces global state into an application.
